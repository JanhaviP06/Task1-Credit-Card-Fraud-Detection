# Task1-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit Card Fraud Detection project is done using Machine Learning.
Here, we have to predict that the transactions are fraud or not fraud.
I have used three Ml models Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and XGBoost Classifier.Wherein, XGBoost Classifier gave the highest accuarcy.

Following operations were performed on the dataset :

1.Exploratory Data Analysis

2.Oversampling Using SMOTE

3.Splitting Data into Train and Test Data

4.Train the data using ML models

5.Compare the accuracy values for models

6.Metrics for the selected model(Confusion matrix, Classification report,ROC_AUC Curve)

7.Prediction
